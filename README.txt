Internship task by guvi
I have used xampp server so kindly do the following steps:
Open xampp control panel and run apache server.
Extract the guvi.rar into C:\xampp\htdocs.
Go to browser and type the url  as localhost/guvi/ to open the first page(index.php).
Now you can use the web application by navigating through the button on every page.

Thank You.
